![BANNER](docs/banner.png)

**Last Modified: 2025-07-20**

CTHmodules is a modular, open-source framework for tetrasociohistorical analysis, centered on the Historical Thematic Coherence Index (CTH). It provides tools to compute CTH, EVEI (Eventual Integral Valuation Structure), Potential Factors (FP), and derived metrics (e.g., IEC, PPI, margins) for analyzing socio-historical events across temporal phases: before, prelude, during, transition, and after. The source code and outputs are available free of charge for certain non-commercial uses under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0) license, in accordance with these Terms of Use and the CTHmodules Prohibited Use Policy.

## Key Things to Know When Using CTHmodules
CTHmodules and its outputs are available solely for non-commercial use by, or on behalf of, non-commercial organizations (e.g., universities, non-profit organizations, research institutes, educational, or governmental bodies). If you are a researcher affiliated with a non-commercial organization, provided you are not acting on behalf of a commercial entity, you may use CTHmodules for your non-commercial research.

You must not:
- Use CTHmodules or its outputs for commercial activities, including research on behalf of commercial organizations.
- Use CTHmodules outputs to train machine learning models or related technologies for socio-historical analysis similar to CTHmodules.
- Share CTHmodules source code outside your organization, except as permitted under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license.

You may publish, share, and adapt CTHmodules outputs in accordance with these Terms, provided you clearly indicate any modifications and note that ongoing use of outputs and derivatives is subject to these Terms.

By accessing, using, modifying, or distributing any portion of CTHmodules or its outputs, you agree to be bound by (1) these Terms of Use and (2) the CTHmodules Prohibited Use Policy (collectively, the “Terms”), as modified from time to time, between you and Alejo Malia.

You confirm you are authorized, either explicitly or implicitly, to enter into these Terms on behalf of yourself or your organization.

Please read these Terms carefully. They outline what you can expect when using CTHmodules and what is expected from you. “You” refers to the individual or organization using CTHmodules, and “we” refers to Alejo Malia, the developer of CTHmodules.

## 1. Key Definitions
As used in these Terms:
- **CTHmodules**: Refers to (a) the CTHmodules source code, licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, available in the CTHmodules repository, and any derivative source code, and (b) CTHmodules Assets.
- **CTHmodules Assets**: Includes the source code, computational models, and Outputs generated by CTHmodules.
- **Output**: Refers to the computational results (e.g., CTH values, EVEI, FP, IEC, PPI, margins) and related data produced by CTHmodules, including any modifications, copies, or adaptations substantially derived from these results.
- **Distribution** or **Distribute**: Means any transmission, publication, or sharing of Outputs publicly or with others.
- **Including**: Means “including without limitation.”

## 2. Accessing and Using CTHmodules

## 3. Use Restrictions
You must not use CTHmodules Assets:
- For purposes outlined in the CTHmodules Prohibited Use Policy.
- In violation of applicable laws, regulations, or the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license.

We reserve the right to revoke your access to CTHmodules Assets if we reasonably believe you are violating these Terms.

## 4. Generated Output
We do not claim ownership of original Outputs you generate using CTHmodules. However, you acknowledge that CTHmodules may produce similar Outputs for multiple users, and we reserve all rights in this regard. When Distributing Outputs, you must:
- Clearly indicate any modifications made to the Outputs.
- Note that ongoing use of Outputs and derivatives is subject to these Terms.

## 5. Changes to CTHmodules or These Terms
We may add, modify, or remove functionalities of CTHmodules or discontinue access at any time. Updates to these Terms will be posted in the CTHmodules repository, effective 14 days after posting, except for changes addressing functionality or legal requirements, which are effective immediately.

You should review the Terms whenever updated or before using CTHmodules. If you disagree with any modifications, you must stop using CTHmodules immediately.

## 6. Suspending or Terminating Your Right to Use CTHmodules
We may suspend or terminate your access to CTHmodules for reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with these Terms. Upon termination, you must immediately delete and cease use and Distribution of all CTHmodules Assets in your possession and refrain from further use. We will endeavor to provide reasonable notice of suspension or termination, except in cases of serious breaches.

If you choose to stop using CTHmodules, we appreciate feedback on your reasons (via [insert contact email]) to improve the framework.

## 7. Confidentiality
You agree not to disclose Confidential Information without prior written consent. “Confidential Information” includes:
(a) Non-public elements of CTHmodules, such as proprietary algorithms or internal documentation, excluding the publicly available source code.
(b) Any information marked confidential or reasonably considered confidential.

This does not include information:
(a) You knew prior to accessing CTHmodules.
(b) That becomes public through no fault of yours.
(c) Independently developed by you without reference to Confidential Information.
(d) Lawfully provided by a third party without breach of these Terms.

## 8. Disclaimers
CTHmodules and Outputs are provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind, including title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using CTHmodules or Distributing Outputs and assume all risks associated with such use. Outputs are analytical predictions with varying confidence levels and should be interpreted cautiously.

CTHmodules is designed for theoretical socio-historical research and is not intended, validated, or approved for practical decision-making, policy implementation, or professional advice. Any content related to such uses is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for qualified professional guidance.

If local law prevents resolution in these courts or application of these laws, disputes will be governed by your local laws and courts. If you represent a government organization, these Terms will be silent on governing law and courts where required by applicable law.

To account for the nature of socio-historical research, legal claims related to these Terms or CTHmodules may be initiated until the later of:
- The cut-off date under applicable law.
- Two years from when you or Alejo Malia became aware, or should have reasonably been aware, of the facts giving rise to the claim.

You agree not to argue limitation or time bar for claims filed within this period, and neither will Alejo Malia.
